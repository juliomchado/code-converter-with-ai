# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

CodeConverter is designed with security in mind for open source deployment. This document outlines our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## ‚úÖ Security Features

### Data Protection
- **No API keys in source code** - All sensitive data is handled via environment variables
- **Client-side only** - No backend server means no data persistence or logging
- **Local processing** - Code is sent directly to AI providers, not stored on our servers
- **Gitignored secrets** - All `.env` files and sensitive data are excluded from version control

### Deployment Security
- **Environment variables** - API keys are stored securely in Vercel environment variables
- **No data collection** - We don't collect, store, or analyze user code or API keys
- **HTTPS only** - All communication is encrypted
- **Security headers** - Content Security Policy and other security headers are configured

## üîë API Key Security

### Recommended Practices
1. **Use environment variables** for production deployments
2. **Never commit API keys** to version control
3. **Rotate keys regularly** as per provider recommendations
4. **Use least privilege** - only grant necessary permissions to API keys

### Supported Storage Methods
1. **Environment Variables** (Most secure - recommended for production)
2. **Local .env file** (Secure for development)
3. **Browser localStorage** (Fallback - consider security implications)

## üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

- **Email**: [your-email@domain.com]
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] CodeConverter Vulnerability Report`
- **Please include**:
  - Description of the vulnerability
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Potential impact
  - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix deployment**: Within 7 days for critical issues

## üöÄ Secure Deployment Guide

### For Vercel
1. Never include actual API keys in your repository
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   ```
3. Use the provided `vercel.json` configuration
4. Enable security headers (included in config)

### For Other Platforms
- Ensure environment variables are properly configured
- Enable HTTPS
- Configure appropriate security headers
- Regular security updates

## üìã Security Checklist
